# Project Introduction
Topic-Body language transmission knowledge

Based on my theme, Body language transmission knowledge.I envision using kinect and projection techniques to build a device for analyzing body language.The purpose of the project is to explain the information of body language to the audience, and the information has different meanings in different cultural backgrounds.

Argument-Using body language can convey information. It is possible to break through culture and language. 
Body language can replace language and express complex emotions.

Statement-Body language is medium for conveying message.
A lot of message collect to become knowledge.
The process can be returned.
This can explain the connection between body language and knowledge.

## Background Resrearch

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning.

Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, communication, and reasoning; while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of acknowledgement in human beings.
Karl Popper classifies human knowledge into seven parts： Common Sense、Experiential Knowledge、Myths and legends 、Scientific Knowledge、 Philosophy、Art Knowledge 、Religion. (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972, Rev. ed., 1979, ISBN 0-19-875024-2 )

Body language, When we interact with others, we continuously give and receive wordless signals. All of our nonverbal behaviors—the gestures we make, the way we sit, how fast or how loud we talk, how close we stand, how much eye contact we make—send strong messages. These messages don't stop when you stop speaking either. Even when you're silent, you're still communicating nonverbally.
