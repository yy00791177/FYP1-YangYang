# Project Introduction
Topic-Body language transmission knowledge

Based on my theme, Body language transmission knowledge.I envision using kinect and projection techniques to build a device for analyzing body language.The purpose of the project is to explain the information of body language to the audience, and the information has different meanings in different cultural backgrounds.

Argument-Using body language can convey information. It is possible to break through culture and language. 
Body language can replace language and express complex emotions.

Statement-Body language is medium for conveying message.
A lot of message collect to become knowledge.
The process can be returned.
This can explain the connection between body language and knowledge.
